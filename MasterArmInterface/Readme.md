# MasterArmInterface

This is the project for the mbed that reads and encodes data from the master arm controller. Like the other mbeds, it connects over ethernet and UDP/IP. As long as the master arm is on the same subnet as the running Mission Control software (and the subnet mask allows broadcasting), using the master arm should be plug-and-play.
