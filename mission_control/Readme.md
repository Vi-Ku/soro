# MissionControl

This is the main project for the Mission Control software suite. As its name implies, this software only runs on the mission control computers, not the rover computer(s).

Mission Control is designed to be run on several computers at once, as a single instance is only capable of controlling one subsystem on the rover (Drive, Camera, or Arm). As long as the network is properly configured, Mission Control should be farily easy to set up and run across multiple computers using the GUI.
